# Biased-Walk (Gambler's Ruin Simulation)

A Monte Carlo simulation project exploring how small differences in initial probability lead to large changes over time.

# About the Project
This project explores the Gambler's Ruin (or Biased Walk) concept. At every step of the simulation, the gambler moves forward or backward based on weighted probabilities.

The program performs two main functions:

Visualizes the path: Generates a graph displaying the "walk" based on specific weights.

Calculates Survival Probability: Runs the simulation thousands of times to determine the statistical likelihood of the gambler retaining money by the end.

# Language and Libraries:
Language: Python
Libraries: matplotlib, random

# Future Scope
This project served as an introduction to Monte Carlo Simulations. My goal is to apply these stochastic modeling techniques to simulate supply chain logistics and manufacturing processes in future projects.
