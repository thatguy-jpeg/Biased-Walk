# Biased-Walk (Gambler's Ruin Simulation)

A Monte Carlo simulation project exploring how small differences in initial probability lead to large changes over time.

## About the Project
This project explores the **Gambler's Ruin** (or Biased Walk) concept. At every step of the simulation, the gambler moves forward or backward based on weighted probabilities.

The program performs two main functions:
1. **Visualizes the path:** Generates a graph displaying the "walk" based on specific weights.
2. **Calculates Survival Probability:** Runs the simulation thousands of times to determine the statistical likelihood of the gambler retaining money by the end.

## Language and Libraries
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** `matplotlib`, `random`

## Files
* `main.py`: The script that runs the simulation and generates the graph.
* `Analysis_Paper.pdf`: A supplementary paper detailing the math/theory.
* `Presentation.pdf`: A slideshow summary of the findings.

## Future Scope
This project served as an introduction to **Monte Carlo Simulations**. My goal is to apply these stochastic modeling techniques to simulate supply chain logistics and manufacturing processes in future projects.
