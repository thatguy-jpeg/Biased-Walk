# Biased-Walk

Language: Python

Libraries: matplotlib.pyplot, random

A coding project made for my introduction to probability class which explores how small differences in probability at the beginning leads to large changes overtime.

The repository consists of a slideshow, paper, and the code. The slideshow and paper are supplementary, but are not needed. 

The Gambler's Ruin, or similarly a Biased Walk, explores when at every step, you can either go forward or backward, with probability weights assigned to each. When ran, a graph will display the path of one run according to each of the weights, and then after runnning this process many many times, will calculate the probability that the gambler will still have money by the end.

This project is meant to explore the basics of Monte Carlo Simulations, which for my studies I will most certainly need to go in depth on. From this, I hope to start projects simulating supply chains or manufacturing in a similar manner.
